# Subagents — catalog and delegation rules

**When to load this file:** if a task feels large / multi-step / multi-module and you suspect it is worth delegating to a specialized subagent — read this file, check the availability of a suitable subagent in the table below, and decide whether to delegate or execute directly.

## Delegation principle

12 specialized subagents are available in the project (full prompts in `content/agents/<name>.md`).

**Delegate when:**

- the work is large enough to justify the subagent launch overhead;
- the task would otherwise drain the parent agent's context window (long traces, large files, mass edits);
- several independent checks can be run in parallel (most subagents have `allowParallel: true`).

**Do not delegate** when the task is a trivial single-file edit — execute it directly.

## Subagent catalog

| Subagent | When to call | When NOT to call |
|---|---|---|
| **1c-analytic** | User asks for a PRD, specification, or analysis of an existing area without writing code | Task is to write code |
| **1c-planner** | A multi-step implementation or refactoring plan is needed before coding | Task is small enough that the plan is 1–2 lines |
| **1c-architect** | Designing the architecture of a sizable modification (new subsystem, integration, multi-module change) | Single-procedure or single-module change |
| **1c-arch-reviewer** | User asks to review or validate an architectural decision before implementation | No architectural design exists yet |
| **1c-developer** | Bulk code writing or modification across multiple modules that would otherwise drain the parent's context | Small local edit (Quick-fix path — see `AGENTS.md → Development Procedure`) |
| **1c-metadata-manager** | Creating, scaffolding, compiling, or multi-step / multi-domain metadata operations (objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions) | Single info lookup or single XML attribute fix — use a direct edit or the `1c-metadata-manage` skill |
| **1c-refactoring** | Dead-code cleanup, consolidation, or deduplication across multiple modules | Refactor is local to one procedure |
| **1c-performance-optimizer** | User reports slowness, or query / loop optimization is the explicit task | No performance concern was raised |
| **1c-error-fixer** | Quick fix of syntax / runtime errors / BSL LS warnings without architectural changes (cheap model — `haiku`) | The fix requires architectural rework — escalate to `1c-architect` / `1c-developer` |
| **1c-tester** | User asks to verify changes via deploy + UI automation against a test infobase | No test infobase available, or the task is purely static |
| **1c-code-reviewer** | **Only when the user explicitly asks for a code review** | Auto-triggering after edits is forbidden |
| **1c-doc-writer** | User-facing documentation: user guides, admin manuals, tutorials, codemaps, API references | Inline code documentation (module / procedure headers) — that is the developer's responsibility |
